# Daniel Felipe Sacristán Ávila – Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of real-world analytics projects built from my experience in **military aviation operations, rehabilitation, and daily life optimization**.

I combine **Flight Ops discipline** with **Data Analytics** using Excel, Power BI, Python and SQL to create dashboards and models that support decision-making.

## 👨‍✈️ About Me

I’m a Colombian Air Force Captain and UH-60 / UH-1 pilot transitioning into **Data & Business Intelligence**.  
During my CVA rehabilitation, I started building dashboards to track flight hours, therapy, transportation costs, and later operational metrics.

Now I design analytical systems that are:
- operationally realistic
- statistically grounded
- visually clear

You can see the projects below.
